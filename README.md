## Description

This is a Node.js application that uses Express.js to build the back end framework and Heroku for deployment. The purpose of this app is to allow users to write, save, and delete notes. For a demonstration of how this app works, please check out the GIF at the end of this document.

To view the deployed app, please check out the following [Note Taker App Link](https://secret-sierra-11600.herokuapp.com/).

## Assignment Overview

For this weeks assignment, we were given a starter code that had the front-end created, and our task was to build the back-end using Express.js. Since this is a note taking application, we used Express.js to funnel user requests for the saving, deleting and retrival of data from a JSON file.

I should note that the delete note functionality was not part of the acceptance criteria but rather as a bonus challenge for students.

### Acceptance Criteria

- When user opens the Note Taker App, they are presented with a loading page.
- When user clicks on the `Get Started` button, the page changes to the notes page where user can write and save notes.
- Only when user enters a new note title and note content, the save button appears in the navigation.
- When the save button is clicked, the new note is saved and appears as part of the list in the left column.
- When user clicks on a saved note, the note title and the note content appears in the right column.
- When user clicks on the plus icon in the navigation, an empty note title and note content is presented.
- When user clicks on the `Note Taker` text in the navigation, they are rerouted to the loading page.

### Front-End Styling

Even though this assignment had the front-end complete, I wanted to take this opportunity to improve my front-end skills and add a little bit of my own personality into the app. See below list.

1. Updated saved notes by adding a date, time and snippet of the text to appear.
1. Updated the font-styling to use Rampart One & Indie Flower

1. Updated the write, save and delete icons.
